🛠️ Djangonaut Diaries
A developer’s playground of Django apps, APIs, and curious code experiments.*

Hey there! 👋
Welcome to Djangonaut Diaries — my space to learn, build, and break things with Django and Django REST Framework.

This repo is a growing collection of projects, experiments, and half-baked ideas I’ve been exploring while diving deeper into backend development with Django. Some are functional, some are for fun — all of them are part of the journey.

💡 What You’ll Find Here

🔧 Mini Django apps — testing out features, patterns, and best practices
🌐 REST APIs — built with DRF for web/mobile integration
🛠 Utility tools — scripts and helpers to speed things up
📚 Tutorial-based builds — concepts I’ve turned into working code

Let me know if you'd like a version of this with your actual repo name or a specific theme!
